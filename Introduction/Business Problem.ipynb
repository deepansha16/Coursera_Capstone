There are countless number of students that are applying to universities in Toronto such as Toronto University, York University, Ryerson University and many more.\n\nAt times, it becomes a task for the student to find on- campus accomodation, and that results in chaotic decisions to find the next best neighborhood to reside in - considering a lot of factors - like access to basic facilites such as the super market, grocery stores, medical shops, malls, theatres, and most important of all - a sense of belongingness to feel more comfortable.\n\nThe goal for this project is to perform an analysis of the the features that distinguishes the neighborhood of Downtown from the others. These features include road connectivity, transportation system, weather conditions, emergency situations management,water resources and easy access to basic necessities.\n\nAll of this analysis will help the students get a better idea of the city, state and the area they will be moving into for a new phase in their lives."
